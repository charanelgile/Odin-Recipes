        <h2>What's a Schnitzel, anyway?</h2>

        <div class="description-section">
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Schnitzel, which originated in Eastern Europe, is a thin slice of
            meat that is breaded and fried. You can make it with chicken, pork, veal
            (wiener-schnitzel), and other types of meat. The word "schnitzel" comes from
            the German word "schnitt," which means "cut."
          </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <div class="ingredients-section">
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Think you can't make chicken schnitzel without frying? Think
            again! This baked recipe imitates that deep-fried feel without using a ton of
            oil. All you need is to employ a couple simple hacks — heat the pan beforehand
            and drizzle the chicken with olive oil twice.
            <br />
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Now here's what you'll need to make crispy chicken schnitzel in
            the oven:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Oil</b></li>
            Unlike traditional schnitzel, this recipe isn't deep-fried in oil. However,
            you'll still need to grease the pan with a little olive oil — it'll add flavor
            and keep the chicken from sticking.

            <li><b>Chicken</b></li>
            Chicken breasts are cut in half lengthwise and flattened with a meat mallet
            until they're about 1/4-inch thick.

            <li><b>Flour</b></li>
            All-purpose flour works with the eggs and seasoned bread crumbs to make a
            crunchy, crispy breading.

            <li><b>Paprika</b></li>
            Paprika lends a smoky flavor to this chicken schnitzel recipe.

            <li><b>Eggs</b></li>
            Two whole eggs hold the breading together and helps it stick to the chicken.

            <li><b>Seasoned Bread Crumbs</b></li>
            You can use store-bought bread crumbs or make your own seasoned bread crumbs
            at home.

            <li><b>Lemon Zest</b></li>
            The zest of one lemon adds brightness and citrusy flavor to the crunchy
            breading.
          </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <div class="steps-section">
          <p>
            Here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this baked
            chicken schnitzel:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li><b>Prepare the Pan</b></li>
            <p>
              Line a baking sheet with foil drizzled with olive oil. Place the pan in the
              preheated oven to ensure the pan is hot before the meat even touches it —
              this will ensure that the breading gets extra crispy during cooking.
            </p>

            <br />

            <li><b>Prepare the Chicken</b></li>
            <p>
              Pound the chicken breast halves with a meat mallet until they're about
              1/4-inch thick. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.
            </p>

            <br />

            <li><b>Prepare the Breading and Dredge</b></li>
            <p>
              Make the breading with flour, paprika, eggs, bread crumbs, and lemon zest.
              Dredge the chicken in the bread crumb mixture.
            </p>

            <br />

            <li><b>Cook and Serve</b></li>
            <p>
              Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Arrange the chicken in a single layer
              on the pan, then drizzle with more oil. Bake the chicken for five or six
              minutes. Flip and continue to cook until the chicken is no longer pink. An
              instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165
              degrees Farenheit.
